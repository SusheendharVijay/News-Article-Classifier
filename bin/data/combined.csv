Tackling a 40 million-year-old conundrum,science,Phys.org - News And Articles On Science And Technology,"Silicate minerals are the major components of most rocks. When these minerals on the Earth's surface come into contact with water, they partially dissolve as they react with carbon dioxide in the water. This dissolved material is then transported via rivers to the ocean, where it is ultimately used by organisms to make marine carbonates such as limestone. In this way, carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere and turned into rock. The process is called silicate weathering—a natural example of carbon sequestration. In the modern world, the rate of this process increases along with the rate..."
