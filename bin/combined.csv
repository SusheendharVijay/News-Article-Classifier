Nathan Ingraham,Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition review: The best e-reader. Period.,"One thing you can definitely say about Amazon’s Kindle: it’s not the kind of device you need to upgrade often, even if you’re an avid reader. I’ve been using the same one since late 2015, and it’s still going strong. But Amazon caught my attention with the 5th-generation Paperwhite. For the first time since the original Paperwhite, Amazon increased the display size to 6.8 inches, from six, and it has narrower bezels than ever before. It also now uses 17 LED backlights (up from only five) and an adjustable “warm light” to reduce eye strain at night.
